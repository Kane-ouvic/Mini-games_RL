# **Mini-Games_RL**

A reinforcement learning (RL) project focused on training AI agents to play classic games. The project uses **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)** to train an agent for playing Mario and implements **both DQN and Policy Gradient methods** to train an agent for Tetris. The goal is to explore different RL approaches and compare their effectiveness in learning complex game strategies.

## **Introduction**

This project aims to train reinforcement learning models to play two popular games: **Super Mario Bros.** and **Tetris**. Using RL techniques, the models learn to maximize their scores through trial and error.

* **Mario AI**: Uses Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to train an agent to navigate the game world efficiently.
* **Tetris AI**: Implements both **DQN** and **Policy Gradient** methods to compare performance and strategy formation.

The project helps in understanding the effectiveness of different RL techniques for decision-making in sequential game environments.

## **Features**

* **Mario AI with DQN**: Uses a deep Q-learning algorithm to train an AI agent to play Mario.
* **Tetris AI with DQN and Policy Gradient**: Trains two different models for Tetris using DQN and Policy Gradient, enabling performance comparisons.
* **Custom Training Pipelines**: Implements training loops, reward functions, and environment preprocessing for effective learning.
* **Inference & Evaluation**: Allows running trained models to test their performance on unseen game scenarios.
